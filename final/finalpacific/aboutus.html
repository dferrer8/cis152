        <h3>The Past <i class="fa-solid fa-mattress-pillow"></i></h3>
        <p>
          The Pacific Trails Resort started from humble beginnings. Established in 1965 & originally meant to be a two cabin rest stop for people traveling along the Pacific Coast Highway. A lot of the activities & amenities we have today did not exist yet, just two cabins with a bed & the only activity was to stare at the breathtaking views. As the years went by and tourist destinations such as Big Sur grew in popularity, we also grew with it!

        <h3>The Present <i class="fa-solid fa-campground"></i></h3>
        <p>
          In the modern day at the Pacific Trails Resort, we have built up a reputation for being one of the top affordable getaway destinations in all of California! Recommended by multiple publications including Tripadvisor & Expedia. Since the days of our inception, we've come a long way from the first two cabins. We went from the single bed cabins to huge luxurious yurts with electricty, gas-top stove, & hot/cold running water! On top of that, we've been able to curate fun outdoor experiences, adding in kayaking along the coast, hiking tours in Big Sur, & bird watching!

        <h3>The Future <i class="fa-solid fa-mountain-sun"></i></h3>
        <p>
          While we soak in how far we've come as a whole, the Pacific Trails Resort strives to continue to grow. Often on weekends & especially holiday weekends, we find the resort completely booked. We would love for more people to be able to discover the beauty of the Pacific Trails Resort & the activities we have to offer, so we are looking to expand slightly up and down the coast without causing any interruption to environment. This should allow more visitors per day while creating new jobs! We look forward to your visit because it's not only fun and relaxing for you but allows us to grow as well & bring the joy to more people.
